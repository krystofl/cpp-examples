# Bazel

## Install Bazel
Install Bazel using [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk):
- download bazelisk from the [bazelisk Releases page](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases)
- make it executable and run it. This will setup Bazel
- copy the executable as `bazel` to `/usr/local/bin/`

For formatting BUILD files, also install buildifier:
- downloaded from the [Bazel buildtools Releases page](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/releases)
- make it executable
- copy the executable as `buildifier` to `/usr/local/bin/`
